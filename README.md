# **The Homework REPL:** 
## An easy to use declarative REPL for quick High-School Homework Caluclations

New to programming? Tired of seeing ERROR every time you try to program? Feel frustrated with your math homework? Want easy yet instantaneous solutions? Have no fear, the Homework REPL is here!


The Homework REPL was designed to introduce students to programming in a beginner-friendly fashion. Learning a new programming language can often be daunting for beginners- new syntax rules, working in a new environment, the list goes on. Using layers of abstraction, we introduce students to the idea of programming by streamlining commands and enabling users to gradually get accustomed to programming and the logic behind it without experiencing through the seemingly endless error messages. 


Using Python and the Google CoLab Jupyter Notebook, we created an interface that works very similarly to how an actual REPL would (hence the name Homework REPL). Users can choose from a plethora of key commands and pass in customized arguments in a declarative paradigm. Using regular expressions, the program parses through the userâ€™s input to identify what operation the user wants to perform as well as the measurements passed in. Helper functions are then called to perform the actual computation and the result is displayed back to the user. 

## How to Use

Use the play button to run the main function.

Then simply use the commands listed in the Syntax Guide to utilise the many mathematical commands in HomeworkREPL.
